- Fast rebuild: construct BVH from a full set in one pass (useful for static scenes or resets).
- Static BVH mode (can be built with sweep SAH for optimality)
- Unit / visual test support
- Static BVH class
    - Use SAH to construct a shallower, higher-quality tree
    - Store data in a flat array instead of pointers for fast access
