- Fast rebuild: construct BVH from a full set in one pass (useful for static scenes or resets).
- Static BVH mode (can be built with sweep SAH for optimality)
- Unit / visual test support
- Implement `getCollidingPairs` between two trees, instead of looping through all entities of one tree.
- Static BVH class
    - Use SAH to construct a shallower, higher-quality tree
    - Store data in a flat array instead of pointers for fast access
- Narrow-phase collision detection in parallel inside the Registry class (atm only broad-phase is parallelized)
- Bullet raycasting
- Change std::set to std::vector for raycast queries everywhere, like in the normal collision detection.
